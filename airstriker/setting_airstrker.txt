ERROR: After October 2020 you may experience errors when installing or updating packages. This is because pip will change the way that it resolves dependency conflicts.

We recommend you use --use-feature=2020-resolver to test your packages with the new resolver before it becomes the default.

gym 0.17.2 requires pyglet<=1.5.0,>=1.4.0, but you'll have pyglet 1.5.7 which is incompatible.


pip install pyglet==1.5.0

Now run the code.
